## 1. Project Overview

The Dynamic E-commerce Price Optimizer is a foundational prototype for an intelligent system designed to automatically adjust product prices on large e-commerce platforms in real-time. This project leverages data analysis, feature engineering, and strategic algorithms to optimize prices dynamically, with the primary goals of maximizing revenue, efficiently clearing inventory, and strategically gaining market share.

This repository contains the core logic and analytical framework for understanding product dynamics and implementing adaptable pricing strategies.

## 2. Problem Statement

In the fast-paced e-commerce landscape, traditional static or manually adjusted pricing models are inefficient and lead to missed opportunities. Businesses often struggle to:

* Respond quickly to competitor pricing changes and market demand shifts.
* Optimize inventory levels, resulting in holding costs or lost sales.
* Proactively adapt pricing strategies to trends, promotions, or economic changes.

This project addresses these limitations by developing a data-driven, real-time mechanism for intelligent price optimization.

## 3. Features & Components

* **Dynamic Price Adjustment Logic** (`get_dynamic_price` function):

  * Revenue Maximization Strategy
  * Inventory Clearance Strategy
  * Strategic Discount Application

* **Robust Data Preprocessing Pipeline:**

  * Missing Value Handling
  * Data Type Conversion

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:**

  * `discount_pct`, `price_per_star`, `review_density`
  * `log_reviews`, `log_bought`, `title_length`

* **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  * Price Distribution
  * Customer Insights
  * Sales vs. Price Patterns
  * Correlation Mapping

## 4. Technical Architecture & Technologies

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
  * `scikit-learn`, `xgboost` for ML and preprocessing
  * `joblib` for serialization

## 5. Key Skills Demonstrated

* Data Science & ML
* Conceptual Time-Series Forecasting
* Optimization Algorithms
* Real-time Data Design
* A/B Testing Framework Design
* Economic Modeling
* Python Programming
* Data Visualization

## 6. Impact & Benefits

* Direct Revenue Maximization
* Enhanced Inventory Efficiency
* Improved Market Competitiveness
* Data-Driven Decision Making

## 7. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed:

```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Dynamic-E-commerce-Price-Optimizer.git
cd Dynamic-E-commerce-Price-Optimizer
python -m venv venv
# Windows
dot\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost joblib
```

### Usage

* Place `amazon_products.csv` in root directory.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

* Open `p.ipynb` and run the cells.

#### Example usage:

```python
product_example = {
    'stars': 4.5,
    'reviews': 100,
    'listPrice': 49.99,
    'isBestSeller': 1,
    'category_id': 104,
    'discount_pct': 0.2,
    'price_per_star': 10,
    'review_density': 0.5,
    'title_length': 50
}

current_product_price = 39.99

suggested_price_max_revenue = get_dynamic_price(product_example, current_product_price, strategy='max_revenue')
print(f"Suggested price (Max Revenue): {suggested_price_max_revenue}")

suggested_price_clear_inventory = get_dynamic_price(product_example, current_product_price, strategy='clear_inventory')
print(f"Suggested price (Clear Inventory): {suggested_price_clear_inventory}")
```
